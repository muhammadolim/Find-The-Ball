## Motivation
This game was inspired by one mobile app which is very similar to this one that is I tried a lot to exactly imitate it :D
## Learning outcomes
I learned to work with audio files and implement them via JQeury. In addition, I become familiar with SVG elements knowing how to create and convert them into code.
## Future ideas
- Do mobile responsive
- Improve speed level system
